1. Create a database named 'vehiclepartstestdb' in xampp using mysql username 'root' and password 'root'. I have used xampp 5.6
2. Copy project folder 'vehiclesearch' in xampp htdocs folder.
3. Open browser and run URL:http://localhost/vehiclesearch/vehicledataimport.php to load vehicle data from vehicles.csv which is already exists in the project folder.
4. Now run URL:http://localhost/vehiclesearch/partsdataimport.php to load parts data from parts.csv which is already exists in the project folder.
